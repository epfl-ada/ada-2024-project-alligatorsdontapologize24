 ## Project title: 
 ### The Feedback Loop of Violence: How Real-Life Violence Shapes Movies and Movies Shape Society

 ## Abstract:
 Cruel fist fights, brutal killings, rough sexual assaults - movies sometimes show more explicit violence than we would like. But do they lead to an increase in real-world violence? Or, on the contrary, do they serve as a release that reduces it? Moreover, do violent historical events impact violence displayed in movies and more generally movie genres? This study analyzes 17077 movies from the CMU Dataset (LINK HERE), enriched with data from the Kaggle Movies Dataset (LINK HERE). Using this data, we examine the correlation between depicted violence in movies and real-world violence by --> GVD Dataset
