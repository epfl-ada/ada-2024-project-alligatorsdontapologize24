    "### Movie data \n",
    "<b>Why 3 datasets ?</b> \\\n",
    "For our purpose, we need movie data and corresponding movie plots. We will restrict the analysis to American movies, leaving us with approximately half of the original dataset — 20,788 movies. \\\\\n",
    "Since we will try to assess the correlation of the data with historical events, the release date is really important. We want to have the precise date, not just the year. However, dropping all rows where the date is not precise will cause us to lose a lot of data, as only 13,335 movies have precise dates. This is where the Kaggle dataset comes in. When the date is not precise, we will try to match the movie with this dataset and extract its date. Using this method, we recover a lot of data and end up with 17,077 movies.\n",

    "<b>Data preprocessing steps</b> \\\n",

    "        <li>Convert plots to lowercase</li>\n",
    "        <li>Put each column of the movie metadata in the correct format. For example, {\"/m/09c7w0\": \"United States of America\"} should become \"United States of America\"</li>\n",
    "        <li>Keep only American movies</li>\n",

    "        <li>Drop NaN values and duplicated rows (if present)</li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "    <li>For incomplete or missing dates, merge with the Kaggle dataset using the movie title, and ultimately the date</li>\n",
