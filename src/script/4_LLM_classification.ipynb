    "    <li><b>0</b> : Ambiguous (Uncertain level of violence)</li>\n",

    "## Dataset\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li><b>Training and Testing Data</b> <br/> Given the limited number of labeled plots available, we will use most of the labeled items for the training set. We will keep five plots as the testing set to evaluate the model (alternatively, we may use the entire dataset and assess labeling quality across the final labeled set) </li>\n",
