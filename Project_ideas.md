Ideas:

1) Influence of U.S. Political Activism on Diversity in Movie Characters

How did U.S. political movements advocating for equality, such as the Civil Rights, Women’s Rights, and LGBTQ+ movements, influence diversity in global cinema? We hypothesize that the prominence of these movements shaped the representation of diverse characters, especially in terms of race and gender, in films worldwide.
We will analyze how the gross revenue of movies with diverse casts evolved over time in relation to these movements, with a focus on the depiction of women. To achieve this, we will use a combination of datasets: the character metadata (character.metadata.tsv), including information on ethnicity and gender, and movie metadata (movie.metadata.tsv), containing the box office revenues. Additionally, we will utilize freely available data on the timeline of these movements, such as information on the Civil Rights Movement from Statista.com.
By parsing plot summaries (plot_summaries.txt), we will also examine how often films address political issues like segregation, racism, or voting rights. Thus, this study analyses how U.S. political advocacy has influenced global film diversity and shaped the financial success of movies featuring diverse characters.

2) Influence of Economic Uncertainty on Movie Genres

How did periods of economic uncertainty, such as the Great Depression, the 1973 Oil Crisis, the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, and the COVID-19 Economic Crisis, influence the prevalence of specific movie genres and the length of films in different regions?
We hypothesize that during financial hardship, people turn to escapist genres like fantasy or science fiction to disconnect from reality. We will examine whether the production of such genres increases during crises and if longer, more immersive films become more popular. Another aspect of this study is to investigate whether audience spending on these genres rises during times of economic distress.
Using movie metadata (movie.metadata.tsv), which includes data on genres, box office revenues, and runtimes, along with publicly available economic data, we aim to explore whether there are regional differences in these trends. By this, we will try to understand if escapist films provide a collective form of relief during economic downturns.

3) Patriotism in Film: Impact of Donald Trump's Election on Box Office Trends

How did Donald Trump's election and patriotic rhetoric influence the U.S. film industry? We will analyse whether Trump's emphasis on "American values" and patriotism has led to an increase in the production of patriotic-themed films, biographical films about American heroes, and war narratives, and whether these themes have contributed to higher box office revenues.
For this, we will utilise publicly available data on Trump's political discourse, such as Twitter posts and surveys, to detect a growing focus on patriotism during Trump's presidency campaign. Moreover, by utilising the movie metadata (movie.metadata.tsv) on genres and earnings, as well as parsing plot summaries (plot_summaries.txt) for keywords like "patriotism," "America," and "hero," we examine the influence of such a focus shift on film content. With this we aim to find out if Trump’s presidency campaign and his political rhetoric has shaped the cultural output of the American film industry.


Answer from TA: --> Grade: Great

Overall, the proposal demonstrates strong potential for insightful analysis of historical and political influences on cinema.\\\\Idea 1: Influence of U.S. Political Activism on Diversity in Movie Characters\\\\Strong but needs more focus. The analysis of how political movements influenced diversity in global cinema is highly relevant, and the focus on specific movements adds depth. The methodology is solid, but the global aspect of the analysis could be challenging. More clarity on how global vs. U.S. film industries will be compared, and how diverse casts will be defined and measured, would strengthen the proposal. The use of plot summaries to identify political issues is a great addition, but the process for parsing and analyzing these summaries could be more detailed.\\Idea 2: Influence of Economic Uncertainty on Movie Genres\\\\Interesting and timely. Analyzing how economic crises influence movie genres is a compelling idea. The hypothesis that people turn to escapist genres during tough times is strong, but more detail is needed on how "escapist" genres will be defined and measured. The analysis of regional differences in response to economic uncertainty is a good addition, but how these differences will be identified and compared should be clarified. Additionally, the method for linking economic data with film data could be elaborated further.\\Idea 3: Patriotism in Film: Impact of Donald Trump's Election on Box Office Trends\\\\Unique but needs refinement. The idea of analyzing how Trump's election and patriotic rhetoric influenced film production and box office trends is intriguing. The methodology of using Trump's public discourse (e.g., Twitter posts) to detect a shift in patriotic themes is creative, but more details on how this data will be connected to film content and box office performance would strengthen the proposal. Additionally, the process of keyword analysis in plot summaries could be expanded to ensure a robust analysis of how patriotism is portrayed in films.
